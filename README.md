# Art-Inspiration

This is a project that should be a basic page that displays artists that I'm influenced by. Their art styles are something I would like to emulate and so the page will be a quick reference point by which I can show others what I want to work towards. Each artist should have their name and main social media links. Later I would like to integrate api's from those social medias to display their most recent works on my page too.
